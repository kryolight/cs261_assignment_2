CS261 Assignment 2
Part I: Amortized Analysis of the Dynamic Array
Name: Martin Nguyen

Questions:
1. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 16 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the array will double in capacity each time new item is added to an already full dynamic array? Now try it for 32 consecutive push operations. As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the big-oh complexity for push?

16 push operations: 8+8+1+7= 24 cost units
32 push operations: 8+8+1+7+16+1+15= 56 cost units
The amortized big-oh complexity for push is O(1+).

2. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 16 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the array will grow by a constant 2 spaces each time new item is added to an already full dynamic array? Now try it for 32 consecutive push operations. As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the big-oh complexity for push?

16 push operations: 8+8+1+1+10+1+1+12+1+1+14+1+1= 60 cost units
32 push operations: 8+8+1+1+10+1+1+12+1+1+14+1+1+16+1+1+18+1+1+20+1+1+22+1+1+24+1+1+26+1+1+28+1+1+30+1+1= 260 cost units
The amortized big-oh complexity for push is O(n+).
